# JavaPizza

Sample API to highlight new features in Java 9 to Java 11

We'll start from a full Java 8 microservice that will emulate a Pizza Store.

Customers can see the menu with available pizza and cost for each.

They can order from menu or build their own pizza.

There is also an endpoint where all orders can be listed.
